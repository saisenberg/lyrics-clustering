"[Verse]\nLadies and Gentlemen\nFellow Americans\nLady Americans\nThis is James Brown\nI wanna talk to you about one of our\nMost deadly\nKillers in the country today\nI had a dream the other night, and I\nWas sitting in my living room\nDozed off to sleep\nSo I start to dreaming\nI dreamed I walked in a place and\nI saw a real strange, weird object\nStanding up talking to the people\nAnd I found out it was heroin\nThat deadly drug that go in your veins\nHe said:\nI came to this country without a passport\nEver since then I've been hunted and sought\nMy little white grains are nothing but waste\nSoft and deadly and bitter to taste\nI'm a world of power and all know it's true\nUse me once and you'll know it, too\nI can make a mere schoolboy forget his books\nI can make a world-famous beauty neglect her looks\nI can make a good man forsake his wife\nSend a greedy man to prison for the rest of his life\nI can make a man forsake his country and flag\nMake a girl sell her body for a five-dollar bag\nSome think my adventure's a joy and a thrill\nBut I'll put a gun in your hand and make you kill\nIn cellophane bags I've found my way\nTo heads of state and children at play\nI'm financed in China, ran in Japan\nI'm respected in Turkey and I'm legal in Siam\nI take my addicts and make 'em steal, borrow, beg\nThen they search for a vein in their arm or their leg\nSo, be you Italian, Jewish, Black or Mex\nI can make the most virile of men forget their sex\nSo now, now my man, you must do your best\nTo keep up your habit until your arrest\nNow the police have taken you from under my wing\nDo you think they dare defy me, I who am king?\nNow, you must lie in that county jail\nWhere I can't get to you by visit or mail\nSo squirm - with discomfort - wiggle and cough\nSix days of madness, hah, and you might throw me off\nCurse me in name, defy me in speech\nBut you'd pick me up right now if I were in your reach\nAll through your sentence you've become resolved to your fate\nHear now, young man and woman, I'll be waiting at the gate\nDon't be afraid, don't run, I'm not chased\nSure my name is Heroin, you'll be back for a taste\nBehold, you're hooked\nYour foot is in the stirrup\nAnd make -- haste\nMount the steed and ride him well\nFor the white horse of heroin will ride you to Hell\nTo Hell\nWill ride you to Hell\nUntil you are dead\nDead, brother, Dead\nThis is a revolution of the mind\nGet your mind together\nAnd get away from drugs\nThat's the man\nBack, back","116997","King Heroin","8417","James Brown"

Defy me in speech!\nBut you'd pick me up right now if I were in your reach\nAll through your sentence you've become resolved to your fate\nHear now! Young man and woman, I'll be waitin' at the gate\nDon't be afraid, don't run! I'm not chased\nSure my name is Heroin! You'll be back for a taste\nBehold, you're hooked!\nYour foot is in the stirrup\nAnd make -- haste!\nMount the steed!\nAnd ride him well\nFor the white horse of heroin\nWill ride you to Hell!\nTo Hell!\nWill ride you to Hell!\nUntil you are dead!\nDead, brother!
